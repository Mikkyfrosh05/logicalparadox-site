  title: How I Work
  summary: Every geek has their own way of doing things...

Every geek has their own way of doing things and we also think that our 
way is best. Sometimes we also will not use the status quo tool for a 
job because we think we can build a better one. Usually, at least with 
me, that decision is made based on the amount of time I think a project 
could take and how much I can learn from the situation.

How I work may not work for everybody, but I hope this gives you a bit 
of insight into some exciting projects that will shape the future of 
how WE work.

## The Foundation

*Computer*: MacBookPro, partitioned to dual boot Mac OSX and Ubuntu 10.10 
running Openbox. I spend most of my time in OSX but I sometimes feel the 
need to tinker and will switch over to Ubuntu.

*Smartphone*: Google Nexus One, rooted, running Cyanogen Mod 7 Nightlies. 
I use the Clockwork Rom Manager to stay on the bleeding edge but also 
backed up. I also use Google Voice so should things go horribly wrong I 
can still conduct business as usual from the comfort of my browser.

*Tablet*: Motorala Xoom, mainly used for reading books or testing sites
on a tablet. I hope to get more into dev for the tablet form-factor as
I am sure it is going to continue to grow.

## Being a Productive Web Developer (On Mac)

I can live in the terminal, and feel most comfortable there. I use a 
combination of XTerm and Mac Terminal with the Visor plugin. A quick 
double-tap of "Ctrl" and terminal slides into view, Quake style.

While we are on the subject of key-commands, double-tap of "Opt" 
TotalFinder gives the same Quake-like experience for Finder, with the 
added bonus of Chrome like tabs. Slick.

Oh, and one more... Alfred.app, a rockin' application launcher, 
is mapped to Ctrl-Space and replaced Quicksilver for me awhile ago.

I have both Google Chrome (beta channel) and Chrome Canary installed. 
Business/Email/Tweetdeck/etc in Chrome; development and testing in Canary.
Chromium doesn't have any addons installed to keep things clean.

I have switched from Textmate to a local install of Cloud9. As a majority
of the code I write is now javascript, it is a beautiful environment to work in.

## Node.js Dev

*One of the new technologies that most excites me is Node.js. It is a server-side, evented IO (huh?), javascript framework based on the Google's V8 javascript engine. It is super fast and really simple to develop on. Also, a number of packages make it even easier. On gihub, check out express (website framework), stylus (alternative to less.js), mongoose (mongodb wrapper), jade (html templating), and socket.io (websockets made easy). I will try to dive deeper into these in the future.
*On the client-side of things, backbone.js makes it easy to build javascript-heavy webapps using MVC logic. Combine that with the node tools and real-time apps are real easy.
*Currently, I host my node projects on an Amazon EC2 instance using node-http-proxy and forever. MongoDB is the NoSQL solution of preference.
*Stay tuned for more developments and releases. Exciting new stuff is on the way as I transition to the new hotness!

## The Usual Suspects

* Ubuntu for servers
* Git/Github for code safety
* Google Apps, Gmail, etc...
* Skype, Google Talk, Adium for communications
* TweetDeck for Chrome
