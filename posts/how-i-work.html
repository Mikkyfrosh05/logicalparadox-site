      <article><p>Every geek has their own way of doing things and we also think that our
way is best. Sometimes we also will not use the status quo tool for a
job because we think we can build a better one. Usually, at least with
me, that decision is made based on the amount of time I think a project
could take and how much I can learn from the situation.</p>

<p>How I work may not work for everybody, but I hope this gives you a bit
of insight into some exciting projects that will shape the future of
how WE work.</p>

<h2>The Foundation</h2>

<p><em>Computer</em>: MacBookPro, partitioned to dual boot Mac OSX and Ubuntu 10.10
running Openbox. I spend most of my time in OSX but I sometimes feel the
need to tinker and will switch over to Ubuntu.</p>

<p><em>Smartphone</em>: Google Nexus One, rooted, running Cyanogen Mod 7 Nightlies.
I use the Clockwork Rom Manager to stay on the bleeding edge but also
backed up. I also use Google Voice so should things go horribly wrong I
can still conduct business as usual from the comfort of my browser.</p>

<p><em>Tablet</em>: Motorala Xoom, mainly used for reading books or testing sites
on a tablet. I hope to get more into dev for the tablet form-factor as
I am sure it is going to continue to grow.</p>

<h2>Being a Productive Web Developer (On Mac)</h2>

<p>I can live in the terminal, and feel most comfortable there. I use a
combination of XTerm and Mac Terminal with the Visor plugin. A quick
double-tap of &ldquo;Ctrl&rdquo; and terminal slides into view, Quake style.</p>

<p>While we are on the subject of key-commands, double-tap of &ldquo;Opt&rdquo;
TotalFinder gives the same Quake-like experience for Finder, with the
added bonus of Chrome like tabs. Slick.</p>

<p>Oh, and one more&hellip; Alfred.app, a rockin' application launcher,
is mapped to Ctrl-Space and replaced Quicksilver for me awhile ago.</p>

<p>I have both Google Chrome (beta channel) and Chrome Canary installed.
Business/Email/Tweetdeck/etc in Chrome; development and testing in Canary.
Chromium doesn&rsquo;t have any addons installed to keep things clean.</p>

<p>I have switched from Textmate to a local install of Cloud9. As a majority
of the code I write is now javascript, it is a beautiful environment to work in.</p>

<h2>Node.js Dev</h2>

<p><em>One of the new technologies that most excites me is Node.js. It is a server-side, evented IO (huh?), javascript framework based on the Google&rsquo;s V8 javascript engine. It is super fast and really simple to develop on. Also, a number of packages make it even easier. On gihub, check out express (website framework), stylus (alternative to less.js), mongoose (mongodb wrapper), jade (html templating), and socket.io (websockets made easy). I will try to dive deeper into these in the future.
</em>On the client-side of things, backbone.js makes it easy to build javascript-heavy webapps using MVC logic. Combine that with the node tools and real-time apps are real easy.
<em>Currently, I host my node projects on an Amazon EC2 instance using node-http-proxy and forever. MongoDB is the NoSQL solution of preference.
</em>Stay tuned for more developments and releases. Exciting new stuff is on the way as I transition to the new hotness!</p>

<h2>The Usual Suspects</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu for servers</li>
<li>Git/Github for code safety</li>
<li>Google Apps, Gmail, etc&hellip;</li>
<li>Skype, Google Talk, Adium for communications</li>
<li>TweetDeck for Chrome</li>
</ul>


<p>Should you want to keep up to date, developers can find me on GitHub; jakeluer or incatern.
I am also on Forrst: jakeluer.</p>
